This directory contains samples of each type of block page we know how
to detect.

The HTTP status-line and header are reconstructed from OONI reports and
are not fully representative of the original pages. For example, we do
not know the original response-phrase (e.g. "OK" or "Not Found") nor the
original header ordering.


== 403-CLOUDFLARE

The famous "Attention Required!" CloudFlare captcha.


== 403-IRAN

Block page used in Iran. There are two places where it may vary. The
first is in the title, which is of the form "M<digit>-<digit>". Looking
at 2462 samples from June 2015, I found this distribution of titles:

	$ grep -h -o '<title>.*' * | sed -e 's/^<title>//' | sort | uniq -c
	     78 M1-1
	     36 M1-2
	    101 M1-3
	     58 M1-4
	     35 M1-5
	     63 M1-6
	     51 M1-7
	     59 M1-8
	     61 M7-1
	     83 M7-2
	     77 M7-3
	     69 M7-4
	     77 M7-5
	     66 M7-6
	     67 M7-7
	     67 M7-8
	    192 M8-1
	    242 M8-2
	    195 M8-3
	    149 M8-4
	    187 M8-5
	    164 M8-6
	    172 M8-7
	    113 M8-8

The second place it may vary is in the source of the iframe. It may be
either of these:
	"http://10.10.34.34?type=Invalid Site&policy=MainPolicy "
	"http://10.10.34.34?type=Invalid Keyword&policy=MainPolicy "
It seems like the "Invalid Keyword" can only happen when the requested
URL has a query string.

Citizen Lab has a variation from 2014 with type="", rather than
type="Invalid Site" or type="Invalid Keyword"; also the source of the
referenced iframe:

== 404-AKAMAI

A black page with "Server: AkamaiGHost". It has the characteristic
Akamai "Reference&#32;&#35;" string.
